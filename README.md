# Learning-Ruby

My learning journey for the Ruby language and Ruby on Rails.

Each folder represents what I wrote as part of watching different learning videos.  I focused on practicality over theory for the videos that were chosen.  Care was taken to add relevant comments and provide extra elements not in the videos to draw more parallels with other languages.

## Project Folders

### Ruby-Syntax

To pick up basic syntax of the language.  Based on the freeCodeCamp video by Mike Dane. <https://youtu.be/t_ispmWmdj>  

### Simple-RoR-API

To pick up the basics of setting up a REST endpoint using Ruby on Rails.  I documented the rails commands and some code in the README to help understanding.
