# Udemy-CompleteRoRDevCourse

Based on the Udemy Course "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" created by Rob Percival and Mashrur Hossain.  <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/>

I am completing this course switching between Windows 10 and Pop_OS Linux -- depending on where I am that day.

Note you can install ruby/rails through normal downloads in Windows or through the package manager.  There are instructions for Windows and Mac in the course itself. I already had Rails 6 installed so installed Rail 5.4.x using Ruby gems per the instructions.  Pretty painless.

Sections 13 - 15 detail the instructions.

## What I Used for This Course

I used Visual Studio Code for the editor which can be found here:  [https://code.visualstudio.com/].  Since I am using this course to actually use Ruby and Rails in my professional life, I also spent some time looking for useful extensions to make coding a little easier.  To that end, I installed the following VS Code extensions.

- Ruby by Peng Lv [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rebornix.Ruby] Ruby language support and debugging for Visual Studio Code.
- Rails by 周鹏 [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bung87.rails] Ruby on Rails support for Visual Studio Code.
- Rails DB Schema by aki77 [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aki77.rails-db-schema] Definition and Completion provider for Rails DB Schema.
- Ruby Solargraph by Castwide [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=castwide.solargraph] A Ruby language server featuring code completion, intellisense, and inline documentation.
- ruby-rubocop by misogi [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=misogi.ruby-rubocop] Provides linting / style suggestions.
- VSCode Ruby by Stafford Brunk [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wingrunr21.vscode-ruby] Syntax highlighing, snippet, and language configuration support for Ruby.
- vscode-gemfile by 周鹏 [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bung87.vscode-gemfile] Provides hover link in Gemfile that refers to online site.

Not Ruby related but was used for making sure the markdown files were properly formatted.

- markdownlint by David Anson [https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint] Markdown linting and style checking for Visual Studio Code.
