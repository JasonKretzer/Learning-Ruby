# Udemy-CompleteRoRDevCourse

Based on the Udemy Course "The Complete Ruby on Rails Developer Course" created by Rob Percival and Mashrur Hossain.  <https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-ruby-on-rails-developer-course/>

I am completing this course switching between Windows 10 and Pop_OS Linux -- depending on where I am that day.

Note you can install ruby/rails through normal downloads in Windows or through the package manager.  There are instructions for Windows and Mac in the course itself. I already had Rails 6 installed so installed Rail 5.4.x using Ruby gems per the instructions.  Pretty painless.

Sections 13 - 15 detail the instructions.
