# Rspec Course

Based on the Udemy course by Boris Paskhaver
<https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/>

A 7 hour introduction to rspec testing in Ruby.

I am using the incomplete files from the course.  The instructor puts both code and tests in the same file.  I am splitting them out into a proper directory structure.  Since this is just plain Ruby, I will put source code in a lib folder (as opposed to an app folder if this was Ruby on Rails).

I have tried to add more comments where appropriate to better explain what is being done in both code and spec files.
