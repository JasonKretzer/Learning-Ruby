# Rspec Course

Based on the Udemy course by Boris Paskhaver
<https://www.udemy.com/course/testing-ruby-with-rspec/>

A 7 hour introduction to rspec testing in Ruby.

I am using the incomplete files from the course.  The instructor puts both code and tests in the same file.  Not a great choice, but it works.

I have tried to add more comments where appropriate to better explain what is being done in the spec files.

As I go through the examples in the course, I change the name of the files to put them in numerical order.
